To know which object you are at the moment, one may use the keyword self. 
>> self
stdout:
main
If you don't specify which object you are, you automatically play the role of the main object that Ruby provides us by default. 


. (dot) means period.
we call the method even? on the object that is the number 2 by placing a period (.) after the object, then adding in the name of the method we want to invoke.
Example Code:
2.odd?
stdout : false

 One may also chain method invocations by simply adding more periods and method names sequentially - each method in the chain is called on the result of the previous method. Go on and try it by invoking next twice on 1 to get 3.
>> 1.next.next

Ruby objects are happy to tell you what methods they provide. You simply call the methods method on them.
Example Code:
>> 1.methods

Try using a method that takes two arguments - use the between? method to determine if the number 2 lies between the numbers 1 and 3.
>> 2.between? 1,3

1.+(2) - to add two numbers would be... clumsy. 
Ruby makes an exception in its syntactic rules for commonly used operators so you don't have to use periods to invoke them on objects.

words = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
words[1]
=>
words = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
words.[](1)

String construction has what is known as a literal form - the interpreter treats anything surrounded with single quotes (') or double quotes(") as a string.
All Strings are instances of the Ruby String class which provides a number of methods to manipulate the string.

It is essential to be able to replace placeholders within a string with values they represent. In the programming paradigm, this is called "string interpolation"
puts "The number #{a} is less than #{b}"

The essential difference between using single or double quotes is that double quotes allow for escape sequences while single quotes do not. What you saw above is one such example. “\n” is interpreted as a new line and appears as a new line when rendered to the user, whereas '\n' displays the actual escape sequence to the user. 

> "[Luke:] I can’t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail.".include?("Yoda")
> "Ruby is a beautiful language".starts_with?('Ruby')
> "I can't work with any other language but Ruby".ends_with?('Ruby')

 It is conventional in Ruby to have '?' at the end of the method if that method returns only boolean values.
> "I am a Rubyist".index('R')
> 'This is Mixed CASE'.downcase

Ruby provides a way to swap the case of every character in it i.e. this method would convert "I Am MixEd" to "i aM mIXeD".
> "ThiS iS A vErY ComPlEx SenTeNcE".swapcase

'Fear is the path to the dark side'.split(' ')
"Ruby".concat("Monk") => 'Ruby' + 'Monk'

The Ruby String API provides strong support for searching and replacing within strings. We can search for sub-strings or use Regex.
> "I should look into your problem when I get time".sub('I','We')
The method above only replaced the first occurrence of the term we were looking for. In order to replace all occurrences we can use a method called gsub which has a global scope
"I should look into your problem when I get time".gsub('I','We')

Regular Expressions or RegExs are a concise and flexible means for "matching" particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. In Ruby you specify a RegEx by putting it between a pair of forward slashes (/)
'RubyMonk'.gsub(/[aeiou]/,'1')
 stdout:
R1byM1nk
'RubyMonk Is Pretty Brilliant'.gsub(/[A-Z]/,'0')
0uby0onk 0s 0retty 0rilliant

The essential difference between using single or double quotes is that double quotes allow for escape sequences while single quotes do not. What you saw above is one such example. â€œ\nâ€ is interpreted as a new line and appears as a new line when rendered to the user, whereas '\n' displays the actual escape sequence to the user.

The previous three methods all ended with a '?'. It is conventional in Ruby to have '?' at the end of the method if that method returns only boolean values. Though it is not mandated by the syntax, this practice is highly recommended as it increases the readability of code.

"ThiS iS A vErY ComPlEx SenTeNcE".swapcase
swaps the case of every letter in the statement âœ”
upcase
downcase

Here is how you find the characters from a String which are next to a whitespace: 
'RubyMonk Is Pretty Brilliant'.match(/ ./)
 stdout:
 I
 As you can see in the output, the method just returns the first match rather than all the matches. In order to find further matches, we can pass a second argument to the match method. When the second parameter is present, it specifies the position in the string to begin the search. Let's find the second character in the string 'RubyMonk Is Pretty Brilliant' preceded by a space, which should be 'P'.

'RubyMonk Is Pretty Brilliant'.match(/ ./, 9)
 stdout:
 P

Ruby uses the == operator for comparing two objects. 

Ruby also has an unless keyword that can be used in places where you want to check for a negative condition. unless x is equivalent to if !x

n english, "ternary" is an adjective meaning "composed of three items." In a programming language, a ternary operator is simply short-hand for an if-then-else construct.
In Ruby, ? and : can be used to mean "then" and "else" respectively. Here's the first example on this page re-written using a ternary operator. 
In such cases, the objects false and nil equates to false.

Every other object like say 1, 0, "" are all evaluated to be true

The methods Array#each, Array#select etc. are the most frequently used loops since the primary use of loops is to iterate over or transform a collection

loop do
  monk.meditate
  break if monk.nirvana?
end

# add a loop inside this method to ring the bell 'n' times
def ring(bell, n)
  n.times do
    bell.ring
  end
end            

This is how you create an array.
Example Code:
[]
 You can also do the same thing by Array.new.
Example Code:
Array.new
Arrays in Ruby allow you to store any kind of objects in any combination with no restrictions on type. Thus, the literal array [1, 'one', 2, 'two'] mixes Integers and Strings and is perfectly valid. 
 Like most languages, arrays in Ruby have indexes starting from 0
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][2] => 3
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][4] => 5
Array indexes can also start from the end of the array, rather than the beginning! In Ruby, this is achieved by using negative numbers. This is called reverse index lookup.
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5][-5] => 1
Append : 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] << "woot"
or
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].push("woot")
 stdout:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "woot"]

Transforming Arrays : 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map { |i| i + 1 }
=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map {|i| i*3}
=> [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
Ruby aliases the method Array#map to Array#collect; they can be used interchangeably. 
names = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'lizard', 'spock']
names.select {|name| name.length>5}
["scissors", "lizard"]

Delete:
[1,3,5,4,6,7].delete(5)


This convention is called "snake_casing" because a_longer_method_looks_kind_of_like_a_snake

Array Loops :
def array_copy(source)
  destination = []
  for i in source
    if i < 4
      destination << i
    end
  end
  return destination
end

or

def array_copy(source)
  destination = []
  source.each do |i|
      destination << i if i < 4
  end
  return destination
end

A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. You retrieve or create a new entry in a Hash by referring to its key. Hashes are also called 'associative arrays', 'dictionary', 'HashMap'
restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 }
restaurant_menu.each do | item, price |
  puts "#{item}: $#{price}"
end
Modify Value in hash:
restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 }
restaurant_menu.each do |item, price|
  restaurant_menu[item] = price + (price * 0.1)
end
Return keys
restaurant_menu = { "Ramen" => 3, "Dal Makhani" => 4, "Coffee" => 2 }
restaurant_menu.keys

Ruby, classes themselves are simply objects that belongs to the class Class.
1.class.class
=> Class

The keyword def is what we use to create a method called perimeter. You will observe that Ruby follows a two-space indentation convention and sections of code are typically closed using the keyword end


class Rectangle
  def perimeter
    2 * (@length + @breadth)
  end
end

def add_two n
  n.next.next
end
=> n + 2

*names -> is a splat array
def introduction(age, gender, *names)
  "Meet #{names.join(' ')}, who's #{age} and #{gender}"
end
You'll notice that the variable names length and breadth have an @ symbol placed in front of them. This is a convention which designates them as being a part of the state of the class, or to use jargon, they are the "instance variables of the class." This means that every instance of the class Rectangle will have its own unique copies of these variables and is in effect, a distinct rectangle.
=> calling introduction(28, "Male", "Sidu", "Ponnappa", "Chonira") returns "Meet Sidu Ponnappa Chonira, who's 28 and Male

def add(*numbers)
  numbers.inject(0) { |sum, number| sum + number }  
end

def subtract(*numbers)
  current_result = numbers.shift
  numbers.inject(current_result) { |current_result, number| current_result - number }  
end

def calculate(*arguments)
  # if the last argument is a Hash, extract it 
  # otherwise create an empty Hash
  options = arguments[-1].is_a?(Hash) ? arguments.pop : {}
  options[:add] = true if options.empty?
  return add(*arguments) if options[:add]
  return subtract(*arguments) if options[:subtract]
end
invoking add(4, 5) returns 9 ?
invoking add(-10, 2, 3) returns -5 ?
invoking add(0, 0, 0, 0) returns 0 ?
invoking subtract(4, 5) returns -1 ?

Lamda

l = lambda { "Do or do not" }
puts l.call
=> Do or do not

l = lambda do |string|
  if string == "try"
    return "There's no such thing" 
  else
    return "Do or do not."
  end
end
puts l.call("try") # Feel free to experiment with this

Both work equally well, but the convention followed in Ruby is to use {} for single line lambdas and do..end for lambdas that are longer than a single line.

eg.
Increment = lambda {|number| number + 1}
puts Increment.call(5)
=> 6

Block

def demonstrate_block(number)
  yield(number)
end

puts demonstrate_block(1) { |number| number + 1 }
=> 2

Ruby optimizes for this use case by offering the yield keyword that can call a single lambda that has been implicitly passed to a method without using the parameter list

Calculate=>
def calculate(a,b)
  yield(a,b)
end
puts calculate(2,3) {|a,b| a+b}
=>5

n order to include a module into a class, we use the method include which takes one parameter - the name of a Module.
module WarmUp
  def push_ups
    "Phew, I need a break!"
  end
end

class Gym
  include WarmUp
  
  def preacher_curls
    "I'm building my biceps."
  end
end

class Dojo
  include WarmUp
  
  def tai_kyo_kyu
    "Look at my stance!"
  end
end

puts Gym.new.push_ups
puts Dojo.new.push_ups

Just like all classes are instances of Ruby's Class, all modules in Ruby are instances of Module.
module WarmUp
end

puts WarmUp.class      # Module
puts Class.superclass   # Module
puts Module.superclass  # Object

Return sum of all sides
module Perimeter
  def perimeter
    sides.inject(0) { |sum, side| sum + side }
  end
end

class Rectangle
  include Perimeter
  
  def initialize(length, breadth)
    @length = length
    @breadth = breadth
  end

  def sides
    [@length, @breadth, @length, @breadth]
  end
end

class Square
  include Perimeter
  
  def initialize(side)
    @side = side
  end

  def sides
    [@side, @side, @side, @side]
  end
end

Namespace collision
Modules can also hold classes. In this example, we'll try and define an Array class under our Perimeter module from the last lesson. Notice how it does not affect Ruby's Array class at all. 

module Perimeter
  class Array
    def initialize
      @size = 400
    end
  end
end

our_array = Perimeter::Array.new
ruby_array = Array.new

p our_array.class
p ruby_array.class

 stdout:

Perimeter::Array
Array

We used the constant lookup (::) 

module Dojo
  A = 4
  module Kata
  	B = 8
    module Roulette
      class ScopeIn
        def push
          15
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

A = 16
B = 23
C = 42

puts "A - #{A}"
puts "Dojo::A - #{Dojo::A}"

puts

puts "B - #{B}"
puts "Dojo::Kata::B - #{Dojo::Kata::B}"

puts

puts "C - #{C}"
puts "Dojo::Kata::Roulette::ScopeIn.new.push - #{Dojo::Kata::Roulette::ScopeIn.new.push}"

You are given a library called RubyMonk. It contains a module Parser which defines a class CodeParser. Write another class TextParser in the same namespace that parses a string and returns an array of capitalized alphabets. 
module RubyMonk
  module Parser
    class TextParser
      def self.parse(str)
        str.upcase.split('')
      end
    end
  end
end

module Kata
  A = 5
  module Dojo
    B = 9
    A = 7
    
    class ScopeIn
      def push
        ::A
      end
    end
  end
end

A = 10

=> return op - 10

File

what_am_i = File.open("clean-slate.txt", "w") do |file|

f.close
File.open("disguise", "r") do |f|
