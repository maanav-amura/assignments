he first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)
[Search for it.](www.google.com)

Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?
Well, do I have [the website for you][another fun place]!
[a fun place]: www.zombo.com					-> This will provide see something fun as a link to zombo.com
[another fun place]: www.stumbleupon.com
